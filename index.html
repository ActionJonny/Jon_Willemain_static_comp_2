        <h3>Top Song</h3>
        <img src="images/John-Lennon.jpg" alt="John Lennon Photo">
        <h4>"In My Life"</h4>
          <h6 id="paragraph-items">Lennon just turned 25 when the Beatles recorded this tender look back on the “people and things that went before.” The song is basically Lennon’s cherished, and somewhat melancholy, memories of his childhood, taking its lyrical cue from the growing cult of singer-songwriters springing up all over the world. Lennon would explore the same topic later in his career, but this is one of his first personal songs.</h6>

        <h3>Top Song</h3>
        <img src="images/paul.jpg" alt="Paul McCartney Photo">
        <h4>"Let It Be"</h4>
          <h6 id="paragraph-items">The title tune of the Beatles' last album (which was actually recorded before 'Abbey Road') reached No. 1 around the same time the LP was released. It's one of McCartney's loveliest songs, and like many of his late-period Beatles tracks, it embraces a more traditional form of pop songwriting (it's basically a hymn to his late mother). As Lennon became more abrasive, McCartney turned more tender. This is him at his very best.</h6>
        <h5>Paul McCartney</h5>

      <div class="George">
        <h3>Top Song</h3>
        <img src="images/George-Harrison.jpg" alt="George Harrison Photo">
        <h4>"Something"</h4>
          <h6 id="paragraph-items">Shockingly, 'Something' is the only song written and sung by Harrison released as a Beatles single (it reached No. 1). It became, next to 'Yesterday,' the band's most covered song (Frank Sinatra infamously gave credit to the song to Lennon and McCartney when he sang it onstage). It's also Harrison's greatest composition, a love song with a killer bridge and subtly moving guitar line.</h6>
        <h5>George Harrison</h5>

      <div class="Ringo">
        <h3>Top Song</h3>
        <img src="images/Ringo.jpg" alt="Ringo Starr Photo">
        <h4>"Don’t Pass Me By"</h4>
          <h6 id="paragraph-items">Starr's best original composition, and the first one for which he received sole songwriting credit, features one of his best vocal performances (his drumming on the song is pretty masterful too). But 'Don't Pass Me By' is also well-known among Beatles fans for dropping another clue into the “Paul Is Dead” mystery file: “You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair,” Starr sings with joyful indifference.</h6>
